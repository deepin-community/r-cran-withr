Description: GNU R package to run code 'With' temporarily modified global state
 A set of functions to run code 'with' safely and temporarily
 modified global state. Many of these functions were originally a part of the
 'devtools' package, this provides a simple package with limited dependencies
 to provide access to these functions.
